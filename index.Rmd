Welcome to our online solutions manual for for An Advanced Guide to Trade Policy Analysis, AGTPA [@yotov2016advanced]. 

This material is intended to provide a comprehensive explanation to reproduce the book's results in R. We don’t attempt to give a thorough discussion of the theory behind gravity models, the references cited through the chapters shall fill those details.

The manual is written for two audiences:

* People who know R and are interested in learning about gravity models.
* People with no R knowledge who know gravity models theory.

We only assume that readers are familiar with linear regression, and that they shall read @yotov2016advanced and @wickham2016r alongside this material.

What we did here was to replicate all the results from the book, made with Stata, in R as a way to contribute to Reproducible Research. R is free and available on almost every operating system. It is a wonderful tool for all statistical analysis.

## Obtaining the datasets and functions

`yotover` is an R package created specifically to distribute the datasets required to reproduce the results from AGTPA. It acts as a metapackage that calls other packages to use several functions that augment R capabilities.

You can get all the functions and datasets if you run these lines from your R console:

```{r install_r_package, eval=FALSE}
# stable version
install.packages("yotover")

# development version
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("pachamaltese/yotover")
```

## Getting the most out of this material
 
You can clone the GitHub repository to obtain the editable R Markdown files:

```
git clone https://github.com/pachamaltese/yotover.git
```

Welcome to the online solutions manual for for An Advanced Guide to Trade 
Policy Analysis (AGTPA).

This material is intended to provide a comprehensive explanation to reproduce 
the book's results from @yotov2016advanced in R. We don’t attempt to give a 
thorough discussion of the theory behind gravity models, the book and the 
references cited through the chapters shall fill those details.

This manual is written for two audiences:

* People who know R and are interested in learning about gravity models.
* People with no R knowledge who know gravity models theory.

We only assume that readers are familiar with linear regression, and that they 
shall read @yotov2016advanced and @wickham2016r alongside this material.

What we did here was to replicate all the results from the book, made with 
Stata, in R as a way to contribute to Reproducible Research. R is free and 
available on almost every operating system. It is a wonderful tool for all 
statistical analysis.

## Reproducing AGTPA results yourself

We created `tradepolicy`, an R package created specifically to to reproduce the 
results from AGTPA. It acts as a metapackage that calls other packages to use 
several functions that augment R capabilities, and it features its own functions
to compute clustered standard errors and much more.

You can get all the functions and datasets if you run these lines from your R 
console:

```{r install_r_package, eval=FALSE}
# stable version
install.packages("tradepolicy")

# development version
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("pachamaltese/tradepolicy")
```

## Getting the most out of this material

You can clone the GitHub repository to obtain the editable R Markdown files:

```
git clone https://github.com/pachamaltese/tradepolicy.git
```

Please read @happygitwithr if you have questions about git or GitHub.

## Acknowledgments

This ebook improved noticeably from its early drafts thanks to useful comments 
and corrections from Alexey Kravchenko, Yoto Yotov, Constanza Prado, Chence Sun 
and Jinbo Hao.

Earlier versions of these solutions started during the development of the [gravity](https://cran.r-project.org/package=gravity) R package, where Hrisyana 
Doytchinova comments and feedback were very valuable.

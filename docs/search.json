(2016) in R. We do not attempt to discuss the theory behind gravity models. The book thoroughly and the references cited through the chapters shall fill those details.\nThis manual points at two audiences:\n\nPeople who know R and are interested in learning about gravity models.\nPeople with no R knowledge who know gravity models theory.\n\nWe only assume that readers are familiar with linear regression and that they shall read Yotov et al. (2016) and Wickham and Grolemund (2016) alongside this material.\nWe replicated all the results from the book, obtained initially with Stata, in R as a way to contribute to Reproducible Research. R is free and available on almost every operating system. It is a beautiful tool for all statistical analyses.",

    "text": "1.6 Changes concerning the second edition\nThe first edition was very conservative in avoiding external libraries (or packages). It only used the strict minimal packages such as dplyr for data cleaning and sandwich for clustered standard errors. We fitted all the models using base R, which was considerably slower than Stata, with a computation time around five to twenty times larger depending on the model link (or family) used.\nThe current edition uses fixest, which reduced the fitting time for all the models by around 95%. The book’s first edition takes around three hours to fit all the models and produce the final HTML. The same process now takes around ten minutes, and we hope these time efficiencies benefit the readers. An additional improvement was to add additional explanations to the codes and review all the text grammar based on the feedback received after publishing the first edition.\nWhile writing this second edition, a critical bug was detected and reported to improve fixest, which gave problems when having more than two fixed effects columns. The details for this are available on GitHub. The possibility of comparing with base R, reporting and getting fixes from the packages’ authors with transparent communication is a tremendous advantage from Open Source.\nAs Professor Yotov told this author once while writing his master’s thesis and the first edition: We should focus on the correctness of our results, then think about computational efficiency. He was right!",

    "text": "2.1.1 Preparing the data\nIf the reader has never used R before, please check chapters 1 to 25 from Wickham and Grolemund (2016).\nIf the reader has only fitted a few regressions in R, without much practice on transforming and cleaning data before, please check chapters 5 and 18 from Wickham and Grolemund (2016).\nPlease see the note from page 42 in Yotov et al. (2016). It is a really important note, which tells us that we need to:\n\nFilter observations for a range of years (1986, 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002 and 2006)\nTransform some variables to logarithm scale (trade and dist) and create new variables from those in the original dataset\nRemove cases where both the exporter and the importer are the same\nDrop observations where the trade flow is zero\n\nUnlike Yotov et al. (2016), here we shall use a single dataset for all the applications and subset its columns depending on what we need. This decision kept the tradepolicy R package as light as possible.\nBefore conducting any data filtering or regression, we need to load the required packages.\n\n# dataset\nlibrary(tradepolicy)\n\n# data transformation\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n# regression\nlibrary(capybara)\n\n# delta method\nlibrary(msm)\n\nStep 1, including subsetting columns for this application, is straightforward.\n\nch1_application1 &lt;- agtpa_applications |&gt;\n  select(exporter, importer, pair_id, year, trade, dist, cntg, lang, clny) |&gt;\n  filter(year %in% seq(1986, 2006, 4))\n\nFor step 2, this can be divided in parts, starting with the log transformation of trade and distance.\n\nch1_application1 &lt;- ch1_application1 |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    log_trade = log(trade),\n    log_dist = log(dist)\n  )\n\nContinuing step 2, we can now create the variables \\(Y_{i,t}\\) and \\(E_{i,t}\\) that appear on the OLS model equation in the book.\n\nch1_application1 &lt;- ch1_application1 |&gt;\n  # Create Yit\n  group_by(exporter, year) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    y = sum(trade),\n    log_y = log(y)\n  ) |&gt;\n  # Create Eit\n  group_by(importer, year) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    e = sum(trade),\n    log_e = log(e)\n  )\n\nThe OLS model with remoteness index needs both exporter and importer index, which grouping variables can create. We divide it into sub-steps: Replicate the computation of total exports, then the remoteness index for exporters, and finally the total imports with the corresponding remoteness index for importers.\n\nch1_application1 &lt;- ch1_application1 |&gt;\n  # Replicate total_e\n  group_by(exporter, year) |&gt;\n  mutate(total_e = sum(e)) |&gt;\n  group_by(year) |&gt;\n  mutate(total_e = max(total_e)) |&gt;\n  # Replicate rem_exp\n  group_by(exporter, year) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    remoteness_exp = sum(dist * total_e / e),\n    log_remoteness_exp = log(remoteness_exp)\n  ) |&gt;\n  # Replicate total_y\n  group_by(importer, year) |&gt;\n  mutate(total_y = sum(y)) |&gt;\n  group_by(year) |&gt;\n  mutate(total_y = max(total_y)) |&gt;\n  # Replicate rem_imp\n  group_by(importer, year) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    remoteness_imp = sum(dist / (y / total_y)),\n    log_remoteness_imp = log(remoteness_imp)\n  ) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nTo create the variables for the OLS with Fixed Effects Model, we followed box #1 on page 44 from Yotov et al. (2016). We combine both exporter and importer variables with the year to create the fixed effects variables.\n\nch1_application1 &lt;- ch1_application1 |&gt;\n  # This merges the columns exporter/importer with year\n  mutate(\n    exp_year = paste0(exporter, year),\n    imp_year = paste0(importer, year)\n  )\n\nThe addition of exporter/importer time fixed effects concludes step 2, and now we need to perform step 3. This step will be commented for now as I found an error in the reported \\(R^2\\) for the PPML model that I show next.\n\n# ch1_application1 &lt;- ch1_application1 |&gt;\n#   filter(exporter != importer)\n\nSome cases require conducting step 4, and we will be explicit about it when needed.\n\n\n2.1.2 OLS estimation ignoring multilateral resistance terms\nThe general equation for this model is \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\log X_{ij,t} =& \\:\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 DIST_{i,j} + \\beta_2 CNTG_{i,j} + \\beta_3 LANG_{i,j} + \\beta_4 CLNY_{i,j} + \\beta_5 \\log Y_{i,t} +\\\\\n\\text{ }& \\:\\beta_6 \\log E_{j,t} + \\varepsilon_{ij,t}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nPlease see page 41 in Yotov et al. (2016) for full detail of each variable.\nThe model for this case is straightforward, and in this case, we need to apply step 4 from the previous section to drop cases where the trade is zero.\n\nfit_ols &lt;- felm(\n  log_trade ~ log_dist + cntg + lang + clny + log_y + log_e,\n  data = ch1_application1 |&gt;\n    filter(trade &gt; 0) |&gt;\n    filter(exporter != importer) # commented out step 3\n)\n\nfit_ols\n\nFormula: log_trade ~ log_dist + cntg + lang + clny + log_y + log_e\n\nEstimates:\n\n|             | Estimate | Std.

This is not the case in base R, where glm() outputs include this data, increasing the model’s size, but this does not affect the model’s predictions and can be changed as the user needs it (Zumel 2014).\nThe model is almost ready. We only need to stick to the methodology from Yotov et al. (2016) and cluster the standard errors by country pair (see the note on page 42, it is imperative).\nThe capybara package processes formulas as:\nresponse ~ slopes | fixed_effects | cluster\nThe model with clustered standard errors is as follows.\n\nfit_ols &lt;- felm(\n  log_trade ~ log_dist + cntg + lang + clny + log_y + log_e | 0 | pair_id,\n  data = ch1_application1 |&gt;\n    filter(trade &gt; 0) |&gt;\n    filter(exporter != importer) # commented out step 3\n)\n\nfit_ols\n\nFormula: log_trade ~ log_dist + cntg + lang + clny + log_y + log_e | 0 | \n    pair_id\n\nEstimates:\n\n|             | Estimate | Std.

(2016) for full detail of each variable.\nOur approach follows box #1 on page 43 from Yotov et al. (2016). Fitting the regression is straightforward.

See page 44 in Yotov et al. (2016) for full detail of each variable.\nWe can quickly generate a list as we did with the previous models. The only difference to the previous models is that in this case that the variables to the right of the “|” operator are the fixed effects, which are treated differently by the fixest package, which is used internally by the tradepolicy package, for faster model fitting.\nPlease notice that the summaries intentionally do not show fixed effects, because there are cases where we have thousands of fixed effects.\n\n# tp_summary_app_1(\n#   formula = log_trade ~ log_dist + cntg + lang + clny | exp_year + imp_year,\n#   data = filter(ch1_application1, trade &gt; 0),\n#   method = \"ols\"\n# )\n\nfit_fe &lt;- felm(\n  log_trade ~ log_dist + cntg + lang + clny | exp_year + imp_year | pair_id,\n  data = ch1_application1 |&gt;\n    filter(trade &gt; 0) |&gt;\n    filter(exporter != importer) # commented out step 3\n)\n\nfit_fe\n\nFormula: log_trade ~ log_dist + cntg + lang + clny | exp_year + imp_year | \n    pair_id\n\nEstimates:\n\n|          | Estimate | Std.

By estimating with PPML, the fixed effects correspond precisely to the corresponding theoretical terms.\nThe data for this model is the same as for the fixed effects model, and one option in R is to use the fepois() function.\n\nfit_ppml &lt;- fepoisson(trade ~ log_dist + cntg + lang + clny | exp_year + imp_year | pair_id,\n  data = ch1_application1 |&gt;\n    filter(exporter != importer) # commented out step 3\n)\n\nfit_ppml\n\nFormula: trade ~ log_dist + cntg + lang + clny | exp_year + imp_year | \n    pair_id\n\nFamily: Poisson\n\nEstimates:\n\n|          | Estimate | Std.

    "text": "2.2 The “distance puzzle” resolved\n\n2.2.1 Preparing the data\nPlease see the note from page 47 in Yotov et al. (2016). We need to proceed with similar steps as in the previous section.\nThe distance puzzle proposes the gravity specification \\[\n\\begin{align}\nX_{ij,t} =& \\:\\exp\\left[\\pi_{i,t} + \\chi_{i,t} + \\beta_1 \\log(DIST)_{i,j} + \\beta_2 CNTG_{i,j} + \\beta_3 LANG_{i,j}\\right]\\times\\\\\n\\text{ }& \\:\\exp\\left[\\beta_4 CLNY_{i,j} + \\beta_5 \\log(DIST\\_INTRA_{i,i})\\right] \\times \\varepsilon_{ij,t}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe difference concerning the last section is that now we need to separate the distance variable into multiple columns that account for discrete-time effects. The \\(\\beta_T\\) terms of the equation reflect this. Perhaps the easiest option is to transform the year into a text column and then use the pivot_wider() function.\nWe need to remove cases where the exporter is the same as the importer and cases where trade is zero for the OLS model. For the PPML models, we need to mark rows where the exporter and the importer are the same, and we need to create the same country column, which is also required to transform the distance variables as shown in box #1 in page 48 from Yotov et al. (2016).\nIn order to avoid creating two very similar datasets, we shall create one dataset to cover both OLS and PPML.\n\nch1_application2 &lt;- agtpa_applications |&gt;\n  select(exporter, importer, pair_id, year, trade, dist, cntg, lang, clny) |&gt;\n  # this filter covers both OLS and PPML\n  filter(year %in% seq(1986, 2006, 4)) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    # variables for both OLS and PPML\n    exp_year = paste0(exporter, year),\n    imp_year = paste0(importer, year),\n    year = paste0(\"log_dist_\", year),\n    log_trade = log(trade),\n    log_dist = log(dist),\n    smctry = ifelse(importer != exporter, 0, 1),\n\n    # PPML specific variables\n    log_dist_intra = log_dist * smctry,\n    intra_pair = ifelse(exporter == importer, exporter, \"inter\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = log_dist, values_fill = 0) |&gt;\n  mutate(across(log_dist_1986:log_dist_2006, function(x) x * (1 - smctry)))\n\nThe across() function is a shortcut to avoid repetition, as in the following example provided for reference without computation.\n\nch1_application2 |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    log_dist_1986 =  log_dist_1986 * (1 - smctry),\n    log_dist_1990 =  log_dist_1990 * (1 - smctry),\n\n    # repeat log_dist_T many_times for T = 1994, 1998, ...\n\n    log_dist_2006 =  log_dist_2006 * (1 - smctry)\n  )\n\nNote that the OLS model shall require filtering when we specify the model because we skipped filtering the cases where trade is equal to zero and both the importer and the exporter are the same. Because the solution for the “distance puzzle” implies different transformations and filters for the OLS and PPML cases, one possibility is to filter in the same summary functions.\n\n\n2.2.2 OLS solution for the “distance puzzle”\nThe gravity specification, which includes \\(\\pi_{i,t} + \\chi_{i,t}\\), means that we need to do something very similar to what we did in the last section.\nWith the data from above, the model specification is straightforward.\n\nfit_ols_distance_puzzle &lt;- felm(\n  log_trade ~ log_dist_1986 + log_dist_1990 + log_dist_1994 +\n    log_dist_1998 + log_dist_2002 + log_dist_2006 + cntg + lang + clny | exp_year +\n    imp_year | pair_id,\n  data = filter(ch1_application2, importer != exporter, trade &gt; 0)\n)\n\nfit_ols_distance_puzzle\n\nFormula: log_trade ~ log_dist_1986 + log_dist_1990 + log_dist_1994 + log_dist_1998 + \n    log_dist_2002 + log_dist_2006 + cntg + lang + clny | exp_year + \n    imp_year | pair_id\n\nEstimates:\n\n|               | Estimate | Std.

These variables are internal border, internal dyad and internal borders for different years.\nThe direct way of obtaining the desired variables is similar to what we did in the previous sections.\n\nch1_application3 &lt;- agtpa_applications |&gt;\n  filter(year %in% seq(1986, 2006, 4)) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    exp_year = paste0(exporter, year),\n    imp_year = paste0(importer, year),\n    year = paste0(\"intl_border_\", year),\n    log_trade = log(trade),\n    log_dist = log(dist),\n    intl_brdr = ifelse(exporter == importer, pair_id, \"inter\"),\n    intl_brdr_2 = ifelse(exporter == importer, 0, 1),\n    pair_id_2 = ifelse(exporter == importer, \"0-intra\", pair_id)\n  ) |&gt;\n  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = intl_brdr_2, values_fill = 0)\n\nNotice that we used “0-intra” and not just “intra” because the rest of the observations in the internal dyads are numbers 1, …, N, and R internals shall consider “0-intra” as the reference factor for being the first item when it orders the unique observations alphabetically. Also, observe the order of the resulting table, the pivoting of the table will put “0-intra” as the first row for the first exporter-importer dyad. This makes the difference between the expected or other behaviours in the next chapter.\nIn addition, we need to create the variable containing the trade sum to filter the cases where the sum by dyad is zero.\n\nch1_application3 &lt;- ch1_application3 |&gt;\n  group_by(pair_id) |&gt;\n  mutate(sum_trade = sum(trade)) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n\n\n2.3.2 OLS standard RTA estimates with international trade only\nThe gravity specification, which includes \\(\\pi_{i,t} + \\chi_{i,t}\\), means that we need to do something very similar to what we did in the last section.\nWith the data from above, the model specification is straightforward.\n\nfit_ols_rta &lt;- felm(\n  log_trade ~ log_dist + cntg + lang + clny + rta | exp_year + imp_year | pair_id,\n  data = filter(ch1_application3, trade &gt; 0, importer != exporter)\n)\n\nfit_ols_rta\n\nFormula: log_trade ~ log_dist + cntg + lang + clny + rta | exp_year + \n    imp_year | pair_id\n\nEstimates:\n\n|          | Estimate | Std.

    "text": "3.1.1 Initial data\nUnlike the previous chapter, we shall proceed by alternating both data transforming and regressions. In the previous chapter, it was possible first to process the datasets and then fit the regressions, but here we need the regressions’ output to create new variables. In any case, we will follow quite similar steps to the last chapter.\nTo do what is shown in box #1 from page 104 in Yotov et al. (2016), we need to convert “DEU” in both exporter and importer columns to “0-DEU” so that the software sets it as the reference factor (i.e., “0-DEU” will be listed before any text string starting with a letter). The book uses “ZZZ,” but in R, “ZZZ” will not be treated as the reference factor, for which case we could have used “AAA.” It is important to mention that box #1 does not show a previous step to filter observations for 2006, which is mentioned on page 103.\nBefore conducting any data filtering or regression, we need to load the required packages.\n\n# dataset\nlibrary(tradepolicy)\n\n# data transformation\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n# regression\nlibrary(capybara)\n\n# plots\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nWe start by defining some parameters to simplify the code. The value for the elasticity of substitution, \\(\\sigma = 7\\), used to set the convergence criteria is taken from the literature. There is an explanation in the original Stata code.\n\nref_country &lt;- \"DEU\"\nref_country0 &lt;- paste0(\"0-\", ref_country)\nsigma &lt;- 7\nmax_dif &lt;- 1\nsd_dif &lt;- 1\nchange_price_i_old &lt;- 0\n\nIt is imperative to arrange the table by importers. Otherwise, there is a difference in the estimated fixed effects that changes the factory prices in the last figure from this section, and here the aim is to fully replicate the two figures from this section in the book. We mentioned this in the RTA effects section from the previous chapter.\n\nch2_application1 &lt;- agtpa_applications |&gt;\n  select(exporter, importer, pair_id, year, trade, dist, cntg, lang, clny) |&gt;\n  filter(year == 2006) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    log_dist = log(dist),\n    intl = ifelse(exporter != importer, 1, 0),\n    exporter = ifelse(exporter == ref_country, ref_country0, exporter),\n    importer = ifelse(importer == ref_country, ref_country0, importer)\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(importer) |&gt;\n  # Create Yit\n  group_by(exporter) |&gt;\n  mutate(y = sum(trade, na.rm = T)) |&gt;\n  # Create Eit\n  group_by(importer) |&gt;\n  mutate(e = sum(trade, na.rm = T)) |&gt;\n  # Create Er\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  mutate(e_r = max(ifelse(importer == ref_country0, e, NA), na.rm = T))\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Step I: Solve the baseline model\nWe start by fitting the model\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nX_{ij,t} =& \\:\\exp\\left[\\pi_{i,t} + \\chi_{i,t} + \\beta_1 \\log(DIST)_{i,j} + \\beta_2 CNTG_{i,j} + \\beta_3 INTL_{i,j}\\right] \\times \\varepsilon_{ij,t}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWith the data from above, the model specification is straightforward.\n\nfit_baseline_app1 &lt;- fepoisson(\n  trade ~ log_dist + cntg + intl | exporter + importer,\n  data = ch2_application1,\n  control = list(iter_max = 500)\n)\n\nWith the estimated model, we can proceed as in box #1 from page 105 in Yotov et al. (2016) to construct the variables for exporter and importer fixed effects. This step is very different compared to Stata.\n\nfe_exporter_bln &lt;- fit_baseline_app1$fixed_effects$exporter |&gt;\n  tibble::enframe(name = \"exporter\", value = \"fe_exporter_bln\")\n\nfe_importer_bln &lt;- fit_baseline_app1$fixed_effects$importer |&gt;\n  tibble::enframe(name = \"importer\", value = \"fe_importer_bln\")\n\nch2_application1 &lt;- ch2_application1 |&gt;\n  left_join(fe_exporter_bln, by = \"exporter\") |&gt;\n  left_join(fe_importer_bln, by = \"importer\")\n\nStill following box #1, we need to compute the variables of bilateral trade costs and multilateral resistances.\n\nch2_application1 &lt;- ch2_application1 |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    tij_bln = exp(fit_baseline_app1$coef_table[\"log_dist\", 1] * log_dist +\n      fit_baseline_app1$coef_table[\"cntg\", 1] * cntg +\n      fit_baseline_app1$coef_table[\"intl\", 1] * intl),\n\n    # outward multilateral resistance (omr)\n    omr_bln = y * (e_r / exp(fe_exporter_bln)),\n\n    # inward multilateral resistance (imr)\n    imr_bln = e / (exp(fe_importer_bln) * e_r)\n  )\n\nTo complete this estimation stage, we need to create a column with the estimated international trade for given output and expenditures. We start by adding a column with the estimated trade for the baseline model, and then we group by the exporter and summarise to obtain the required column \\(\\xi\\)-baseline.\n\nch2_application1 &lt;- ch2_application1 |&gt;\n  mutate(tradehat_bln = predict(fit_baseline_app1, ch2_application1)) |&gt;\n  group_by(exporter) |&gt;\n  mutate(xi_bln = sum(tradehat_bln * (exporter != importer), na.rm = T)) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Step II: Define a counterfactual scenario\nBox #2 from page 105 in Yotov et al. (2016) proposes two alternatives to define the counterfactual scenario of removing international borders. The first alternative is to eliminate the border variable and generate the logged trade costs used in the constraint.\n\nch2_application1 &lt;- ch2_application1 |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    tij_cfl = exp(fit_baseline_app1$coef_table[\"log_dist\", 1] * log_dist +\n      fit_baseline_app1$coef_table[\"cntg\", 1] * cntg)\n  )\n\nThe second alternative is to define a new counterfactual border variable. We only show this equivalent case without computation.\n\nch2_application1 &lt;- ch2_application1 |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    intl_cfl = 0,\n    tij_bln = exp(fit_baseline_app1$coef_table[\"log_dist\", 1] * log_dist +\n      fit_baseline_app1$coef_table[\"cntg\", 1] * cntg +\n      fit_baseline_app1$coef_table[\"intl\", 1] * intl_cfl)\n  )\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Step III: Solve the counterfactual model\nWe need to fit a model similar to the model from step I, the constrained gravity model, where \\(\\pi_{j,t}\\) and \\(\\chi_{j,t}\\) are altered as in the equation\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nX_{ij,t} =& \\:\\exp\\left[\\pi_{i,t}^{CFL} + \\chi_{i,t}^{CFL} + \\beta_1 \\log(DIST)_{i,j} + \\beta_2 CNTG_{i,j} + \\beta_3 INTL_{i,j}\\right] \\times \\varepsilon_{ij,t}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nBox #1 from page 106 in Yotov et al. (2016) estimates the constrained gravity model with the PPML estimator using an offset argument, which is straightforward in R.\n\nfit_counterfactual_app1 &lt;- fepoisson(\n  trade ~ 0 | exporter + importer,\n  data = ch2_application1,\n  offset = ~ log(tij_cfl),\n  control = list(iter_max = 500)\n)\n\nAs in the previous chapter, we need to extract the fixed effects.\n\nfe_exporter_cfl &lt;- fit_counterfactual_app1$fixed_effects$exporter |&gt;\n  tibble::enframe(name = \"exporter\", value = \"fe_exporter_cfl\")\n\nfe_importer_cfl &lt;- fit_counterfactual_app1$fixed_effects$importer |&gt;\n  tibble::enframe(name = \"importer\", value = \"fe_importer_cfl\")\n\nch2_application1 &lt;- ch2_application1 |&gt;\n  left_join(fe_exporter_cfl, by = \"exporter\") |&gt;\n  left_join(fe_importer_cfl, by = \"importer\")\n\nNow we go for Box #2 from page 106 in Yotov et al. (2016), where the authors obtain the bilateral trade costs and multilateral resistances variables.\n\nch2_application1 &lt;- ch2_application1 |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    # outward multilateral resistance (omr)\n    omr_cfl = y * (e_r / exp(fe_exporter_cfl)),\n\n    # inward multilateral resistance (imr)\n    imr_cfl = e / (exp(fe_importer_cfl) * e_r)\n  )\n\nBox #2 also shows how to compute trade’s conditional general equilibrium effects, similar to what we did in step I.\n\nch2_application1 &lt;- ch2_application1 |&gt;\n  mutate(tradehat_cfl = predict(fit_counterfactual_app1, ch2_application1)) |&gt;\n  group_by(exporter) |&gt;\n  mutate(xi_cfl = sum(tradehat_cfl * (exporter != importer), na.rm = T)) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nBox #1 from page 107 in Yotov et al. (2016) can be simplified with R code. To construct the iterative procedure to converge to full endowment general equilibrium effects, we start by creating the required columns and parameters so that we will deviate from the original approach.\nWe start computing the change in bilateral trade costs (changes in \\(t_{ij}\\)) and trade deficit or surplus (\\(\\phi\\)).\n\nch2_application1 &lt;- ch2_application1 |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    change_tij = tij_cfl / tij_bln,\n    phi = ifelse(importer == exporter, e / y, 0)\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(exporter) |&gt;\n  mutate(phi = max(phi, na.rm = T)) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nWe compute the change in prices for exporters (changes in \\(p_i\\)) and importers (changes in \\(p_j\\)).\n\nch2_application1 &lt;- ch2_application1 |&gt;\n  group_by(exporter) |&gt;\n  mutate(change_p_i = ((exp(fe_exporter_cfl) / e_r) /\n    (exp(fe_exporter_bln) / e_r))^(1 / (1 - sigma))) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  group_by(importer) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    change_p_j = ifelse(importer == exporter, change_p_i, 0),\n    change_p_j = max(change_p_j, na.rm = T)\n  ) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nNext, we need to compute the counterfactual trade flows.\n\nch2_application1 &lt;- ch2_application1 |&gt;\n  mutate(trade_cfl = tradehat_cfl * change_p_i * change_p_j)\n\nTo conclude the steps from Box #1 we need a while() loop and iterate until convergence is reached. We need to duplicate some columns under new names for the loop operations because we will overwrite them using the iterative steps.\n\nch2_application1 &lt;- ch2_application1 |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    omr_cfl_0 = omr_cfl,\n    imr_cfl_0 = imr_cfl,\n    change_imr_full_0 = 1,\n    change_omr_full_0 = 1,\n    change_p_i_0 = change_p_i,\n    change_p_j_0 = change_p_j,\n    fe_exporter_cfl_0 = fe_exporter_cfl,\n    fe_importer_cfl_0 = fe_importer_cfl,\n    tradehat_0 = tradehat_cfl,\n    e_r_cfl_0 = e_r\n  )\n\nWe run the loop, which cannot be divided into smaller pieces because the step \\(N\\) depends on the step \\(N-1\\).

To replicate the results from box #1 on page 112 in Yotov et al.

(2016) can be divided into smaller chunks. We start by filtering to keep the observation from 1994, and then we compute the trade costs (\\(\\bar{t}_{ij}\\) and \\(t_{ij}^{BLN}\\)) from the internal dyads fixed effects and the estimated RTA coefficient.\n\nch2_application2 &lt;- ch2_application2 |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    tij_bar = exp(fe_pair_id_2_bln),\n    tij_bln = exp(fe_pair_id_2_bln + fit_baseline_app2$coef_table[\"rta\", 1] * rta)\n  )\n\nWe need to create a table for the year 1994 and international flows, which we will use to predict the trade costs for the observations with zero trade flows. The reason to create a sub-table, instead of filtering observations in the regression function, is that it eases posterior work to predict the costs.\n\nch2_application2_2 &lt;- ch2_application2 |&gt;\n  filter(year == year_rta, exporter != importer)\n\nNow, unlike the book, which duplicates \\(\\overline{t_{ij}}\\) by creating \\(t_{ij}\\), we can fit a regression to estimate the costs. This is something that emerges from the small differences between expressing an idea in Stata or R.\n\nfit_costs_app2 &lt;- fepoisson(\n  tij_bar ~ log_dist + cntg + lang + clny | exporter + importer,\n  data = ch2_application2_2,\n  control = list(iter_max = 500)\n)\n\nWith the regression, we add the fitted values to the sub-table.\n\nch2_application2_2 &lt;- ch2_application2_2 |&gt;\n  mutate(tij_no_rta = predict(fit_costs_app2, newdata = ch2_application2_2)) |&gt;\n  select(exporter, importer, tij_no_rta)\n\nThe final step is to keep the observations for the year 1994 in the original table and replace the missing costs with the predicted values.\n\nch2_application2 &lt;- ch2_application2 |&gt;\n  filter(year == year_rta) |&gt;\n  left_join(ch2_application2_2, by = c(\"exporter\", \"importer\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    tij_bar = ifelse(is.na(tij_bar), tij_no_rta, tij_bar),\n    tij_bln = ifelse(is.na(tij_bln), tij_bar * exp(fit_baseline_app2$coef_table[\"rta\", 1] * rta), tij_bln)\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(-tij_no_rta)\n\nBox #2 from page 113 in Yotov et al. (2016) is easier to replicate. The first part of completing Box #2 involves solving the constrained baseline gravity model.\n\nfit_constrained_app2 &lt;- fepoisson(\n  trade ~ 0 | exporter + importer,\n  data = ch2_application2,\n  offset = ~ log(tij_bln),\n  control = list(iter_max = 500)\n)\n\nWith the fitted model, we can add the prediction and the \\(\\xi^{BLN}\\) column.\n\nch2_application2 &lt;- ch2_application2 |&gt;\n  mutate(tradehat_bln = predict(fit_constrained_app2, ch2_application2)) |&gt;\n  group_by(exporter) |&gt;\n  mutate(xi_bln = sum(tradehat_bln * (exporter != importer), na.rm = T)) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nThe book specifies that all other baseline indexes of interest can be obtained by applying the same procedure described in the previous application. Here we will obtain the multilateral resistances terms (\\(OMR^{BLN}\\) and \\(IMR^{BLN}\\)) by adding the fixed effects from the constrained model to the data.\n\nfe_exporter_cns &lt;- fit_constrained_app2$fixed_effects$exporter |&gt;\n  tibble::enframe(name = \"exporter\", value = \"fe_exporter_cns\")\n\nfe_importer_cns &lt;- fit_constrained_app2$fixed_effects$importer |&gt;\n  tibble::enframe(name = \"importer\", value = \"fe_importer_cns\")\n\nch2_application2 &lt;- ch2_application2 |&gt;\n  left_join(fe_exporter_cns, by = \"exporter\") |&gt;\n  left_join(fe_importer_cns, by = \"importer\")\n\nch2_application2 &lt;- ch2_application2 |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    omr_bln = y * e_r / exp(fe_exporter_cns),\n    imr_bln = e / (exp(fe_importer_cns) * e_r)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Step II: Define a counterfactual scenario\nBox #1 from page 114 in Yotov et al.
